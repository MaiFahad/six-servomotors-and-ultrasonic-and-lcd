# six-servomotors-and-ultrasonic-and-lcd
Controlling six ServoMotors by UltraSonic and display it on the LCD
Description

The circuit contains six servomotors with intial degree value of the position which is zero as assumption. The value will be determined by the Mechanical Engineer.
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic will measure the distanceo and based on the signals our motors will move.
LCD displays the measured distance from the ultrasonic and different message for each case.
